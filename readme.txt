Sortable ID columns for all standard data types in WordPress admin panel.

== Description ==

Minimalistic fork of "Reveal IDs" plugin.

ID columns will be first in admin panel tables.

= Differences from "Reveal IDs" plugin =

This plugin contains only functionality for id colums creation ( i.e. deleted options page from admin panel and some backward compatibility code ).

"Reveal IDs" code was pretty much rewritten. But the basic functionality remains the same. ID columns will be first in admin panel tables.

= Plugins with same functionality =

<a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/reveal-ids-for-wp-admin-25/">Reveal IDs</a> &mdash; HH sortable ID columns is fork of this plugin.
<a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/codepress-admin-columns/">Codepress Admin Columns</a> &mdash; Complex solution to manage custom columns in admin panel ( not only ID ).
<a href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-show-ids/">WP Show IDs ( simple, yet elegant )</a> &mdash; Not updated since 2011, but reviews says that it works.
